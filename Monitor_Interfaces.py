'''
The goal of this script is to monitor the "up" interfaces on switches that you choose
and notify the administrator, through email, when one of those interfaces goes down

How to call:
python Monitor_Interfaces <list_switches> <email_info>

File Formats:

<list_switches> should include the hostname and ip address of the switches. Ex:
N9K1 1.1.1.1
N9K2 2.2.2.2

<email_info> should include email address and password (This should be changed in the future)
email@email.com password

Side Notes (How to use):
You will first be prompted with the list of switches and IP addresses that you provided
in the text file. Please enter each switch you would like to monitor seperated by commas
for example:
	N9K1,N9K2,N9K3
