9k_scripts
========

These scripts are basic scripts created for practice scripting against Cisco's Nexus 9K switches. 

#### Requirements

Each script requires a text file to read in the ip address, username and password.
Your file should be formatted with the three items as follows:

'ip address' 'username' 'password'

'ip address' 'username' 'password'

'ip address' 'username' 'password'

etc..

Some scripts require the device.py module to be downloaded as well.
