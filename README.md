<b>9k_scripts</b>

These scripts are basic scripts created for practice scripting against Cisco's Nexus 9K switches. 

<b>Requirements</b>

Each script requires a text file to read in the ip address, username and password.
Your file should be formatted with the three items as follows:

<ip address> <username> <password>
<ip address> <username> <password>
<ip address> <username> <password>
etc..

Some scripts require the device.py module to be downloaded as well.
